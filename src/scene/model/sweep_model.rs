// EXTRUDE / REVOLVE: turning a drawn profile into a solid.
//
// The profile comes from `entities::curve`, which is where every entity's
// geometry is already defined once, so a circle, an arc-bulged polyline and a
// closed spline all arrive as the same thing: a plane plus a chain of curves
// in that plane's coordinates. The kernel sweeps that chain into analytic
// surfaces — a straight run into a plane, an arc into a cylinder, a profile
// turned about an axis into a cone, a sphere or a torus — so the result can
// be written back out as ACIS rather than as facets.
//
// A spline profile has no analytic side wall, so it is refused rather than
// approximated into a surface nobody asked for. That is the kernel's answer
// and this module passes it on.
